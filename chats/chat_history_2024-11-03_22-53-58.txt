User question: how much paid time off do we get?
Bot response: According to the document, employees can receive up to six (6) weeks of Paid Parental Leave in a 12-month period, following the birth of a child. Additionally, for birthing mothers, Paid Birth and Recovery Leave may be taken immediately after childbirth, which runs concurrently with Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) leave and/or state disability leave, providing a total of up to 12 weeks of paid leave in a 12-month period (6 weeks of PBRL and 6 weeks of Paid Parental Leave). 

Other forms of paid time off are not specified in the provided information. For specifics on additional PTO or vacation days outside of these parental leave benefits, you may need to refer to other sections of the employee handbook or inquire directly with the Human Resources office.
